Hashes and Symbols -- other data distinct from arrays

we know in ruby we make a string like my name, which is "Ben" and we can assign that string to a variable.

variable = "Ben"
:Ben

i might say
name = : Ben   (never changes)   i might use this because it enables some optimizations inside of ruby.


hash helps us name arguments we put into functions

arrays refer to ways of storing data in little buckets

r = [e1, e2, e3, e4]
arr = [1] #takes me to element 2.

Hashes

data types indexed by an arbitrary value.
